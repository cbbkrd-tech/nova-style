Sandbox
The sandbox environment is a dedicated testing platform that replicates the production API behavior, allowing you to safely develop and test your integration without affecting real data. It provides all API functionalities, enabling thorough testing of your implementation before going live. Using the sandbox environment is strongly recommended during the development phase to ensure your integration works correctly before connecting to the production environment.

To obtain the client_id  and client_secret credentials necessary for sandbox access, contact integracja@inpost.pl is required.
